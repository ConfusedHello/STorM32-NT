# STorM32-NT
A fork of boards from the STorM32 BGC project for my own purposes. I've panelised a few boards into a single panel to save PCB production costs as well as the pain of multiple orders.

The motor controller is based off the `STorM32 NT Motor v42EC G4` designed by [@KrattWorks](https://bitbucket.org/teamkrattworks/), details about modifications made can be found in this [README](/modules/Motor/README.md).

The STorM32 project is open source hardware, and is licenced under the terms of the [TAPR Open Hardware License](https://tapr.org/the-tapr-open-hardware-license/) as published by the Free Hardware Foundation.
