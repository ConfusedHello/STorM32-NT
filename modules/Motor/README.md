# STorM32 NT Motor Controller
Custom version of the STorM32 NT Motor Controller modified from the STorM32 NT Motor v42EC G4.

Modifications made:
- Removed NTX bus from back for easier mounting
- Removed NTX bus pads as unused
- Removed unused SWDIO/SWCLK pins because I though they were unused for a external encoder and now I cant be bothered adding them back
- Moved some components to accomodate new NTX bus on front
- Cleaned up some traces
- Removed excess mounting holes/drill holes
